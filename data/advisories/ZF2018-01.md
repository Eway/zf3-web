# ZF2018-01: URL Rewrite vulnerability

[zend-diactoros](https://docs.zendframework.com/zend-diactoros) (and, by
extension, [Expressive](https://getexpressive.org)),
[zend-http](https://docs.zendframework.com/zend-http) (and, by extension,
[Zend Framework MVC projects](https://docs.zendframework.com/zend-mvc/quick-start)),
and [zend-feed](https://docs.zendframework.com/zend-feed) (specifically, its
PubSubHubbub sub-component) each contain a potential URL rewrite exploit. In
each case, marshaling a request URI includes logic that introspects HTTP request
headers that are specific to a given server-side URL rewrite mechanism.

When these headers are present on systems not running the specific URL rewriting
mechanism, the logic would still trigger, allowing a malicious client or proxy
to emulate the headers to request arbitrary content.

## Action Taken

In each of the affected components, we have removed support for the specific
request headers. Users can provide support within their applications to
re-instate the logic if they are using the specific URL rewrite mechanism; users
are encouraged to filter these headers in their web server prior to any rewrites
to ensure their validity.

The patch resolving the vulnerability is available in:

- zend-diactoros, 1.8.4
- zend-http, 2.8.1
- zend-feed, 2.10.3

Zend Framework MVC, Apigility, and Expressive users will receive relevant
updated components via `composer update`.

We highly recommend all users of affected projects update immediately.
